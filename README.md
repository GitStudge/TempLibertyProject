 Code for the Shower Shield created by Temp Liberty for the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Capstone Project.
 The Shower Shield is an attachment that sits in between the shower arm and shower head. 
 A waterproof sensor rests in there and connects to an arduino that sits in a 3D-printed water-resistant box.
 The box has a three-layer design that houses a 20x4 LCD Display on top, an Arduino UNO in the middle, and a 9V battery holder on the bottom.
